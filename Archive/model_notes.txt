# New alignment model

# old model, think about LIWC categories independently
# look at last utterance, did marker occur or not
# if not, prob of a marker is drawn from some baseline distribution
# if it did, prob of a marker is drawing from transformed distribution that (through inv logit transform) results in increased likelihood
# results in length confound

# instead, each word in utterances is drawn from multinomial distribution

Multinomial(beta0, beta1 + 2alpha1, beta2 + alpha2, etc.)
# scalar of alpha_n is based on number of instances of each liwc category

# try combining sentences with the same frequency of occurrences within each liwc category
	# unclear how many utterances this will reduce to


# for every utterance count up the instances of every liwc category (and length)
# create categories by parent, session based on liwc count distribution


# to reduce input again, potentially reduce population-level distribution (i.e., parse data into two groups according to speaker; run once on each)
