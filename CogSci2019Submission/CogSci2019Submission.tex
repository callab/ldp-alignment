\begin{abstract}
Children quickly gain enormous linguistic knowledge during early
development, in part due to low-level features of their parents' speech.
Some posit that parents contribute to their child's language development
by tuning their own language according to their child's developmental
abilities and needs (Bruner, 1985; Snow, 1972). Here, we investigate
this hypothesis by examining `alignment' at the level of syntax and
function words in a large-scale corpus of parent-child conversations and
measuring its association with language development outcomes. To do so,
we employ a statistical model of alignment to estimate its presence in
our dataset and its predictive impact on a measure of vocabulary
development. Our results corroborate previous findings, showing strong
alignment for both parents and children; in addition, we demonstrate
that parental alignment is a significant predictor of language maturity
independent of demographic features, suggesting that parental tuning has
strong ties to a child's language development.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Children make vast linguistic strides within their first few years of
life. In light of this, some researchers have offered the linguistic
tuning hypothesis, arguing that parents bolster their child's early
language learning by calibrating the complexity of their speech to the
particular abilities and needs of their children (Montag \& MacDonald,
2015; Snow, 1972; Thiessen, Hill, \& Saffran, 2005). The idea is
intuitive, but it is unclear at what level of language tuning occurs
(Hayes \& Ahrens, 1988; Sokolov, 1993; Spivey \& Dale, 2006) and how
overt it is (Brown \& Hanlon, 1970; Chouinard \& Clark, 2003;
Hirsh-Pasek, Treiman, \& Schneiderman, 1984).

A parallel yet complementary vein of language development research
investigates the presence of low-level cues in parental speech and their
influence on child language learning. From this research, we know that
child-directed speech contains features that facilitate language
learning, and that more exposure tends to result in better outcomes
(Cameron-Faulkner, Lieven, \& Tomasello, 2003; Weisleder \& Fernald,
2013). Related, caregivers from families of high socioeconomic status
(SES) tend to converse more with their children than their lower SES
counterparts, and these increases are associated with improved
development outcomes such as vocabulary size and school performance
(Hoff, 2003; Walker, Greenwood, Hart, \& Carta, 1994). Moreover,
differences in SES-based language development are largely explained by
low-level features of parental child-directed speech such as lexical
diversity and sentence complexity (Hoff-Ginsberg, 1998; Rowe, 2008). So,
given that granular aspects of parental speech can have substantial
effects on a child's language development, it may be that linguistic
tuning occurs at this level in subtle ways, particularly when it comes
to non-content words (i.e., words that are not central to the topic of
discussion.)

This idea of assessing the direct impact of a parent's usage of
non-content words on language development relates to linguistic
alignment, a phenomenon whereby conversational partners tend to align
aspects of their communicative style and content according to various
external influences (Pennebaker, Booth, Boyd, \& Francis, 2015).
Alignment can occur at various levels of language, with some research
(including ours) focusing on the level of quasi-syntactic categories
(e.g., Ireland et al., 2010; Niederhoffer \& Pennebaker, 2016). These
categories don't strictly describe syntax; instead, they aim to capture
function words, which are more invariant to context than content words.
However, we often use the phrase `syntactic alignment' here as shorthand
for `alignment within function word categories.' As an example, see the
exchange between a child and parent presented in Table 1. The parent's
usage of ``across'' directly following their child's usage of ``across''
presents alignment within the category of prepositions. Alignment need
not involve repetition however; the child's use of ``I'' following their
parent's use of ``I'll'' serves as alignment within a category as well
(the category of `I' pronoun words.) Alignment between parents and
children may lend support to the linguistic tuning hypothesis - if
parents align to their children in a way that changes across
development, and that alignment has a concrete impact on a child's
language acquisition, the tuning hypothesis could be vindicated (Bruner,
1985).

Yurovsky, Doyle, \& Frank (2016) investigates linguistic alignment in
CHILDES (MacWhinney, 2000), a natural language corpus of conversations
between parents and children to assess whether tuning occurs at the
level of function word categories. They find that alignment does occur
between both parents and children; moreover, parents align less over
time, suggesting that the relationship their speech shares with their
child's changes as a function of development. These results present a
powerful proof of concept that alignment within function word categories
exists between parents and children and changes over time, but it
remains unclear whether alignment bears any sort of concrete, impactful
relationship to language development.

Here, we extend Yurovsky, Doyle, and Frank's (2016) model by applying it
to the Language Development Project (LDP) (Goldin-Meadow et al., 2014),
a corpus of ecological conversations between parents and their children
over time, collected from a socioeconomically diverse sample of
parent-child dyads. The variability present within this dataset aids our
estimation by offering a more robust picture of alignment as it actually
occurs. We follow their method of assessing alignment only within
function words. Moreover, we use alignment estimates alongside
demographic information to predict measures of vocabulary development,
supporting the linguistic tuning hypothesis by concretely showing how
parents' sensitivity to their child's linguistic needs and abilities
covaries with their development.

\hypertarget{model}{%
\section{Model}\label{model}}

The linguistic tuning hypothesis predicts that parents will calibrate
their language in part by assessing their child's needs and abilities.
So, we predict that parents will exhibit high alignment to their young
children, but will reduce their alignment as their children mature (and
improve in linguistic maturity.) To test this prediction, we employ an
extended version of the Hierarchical Alignment Model implemented in
Yurovsky et al. (2016) which both estimates the impact of a speaker's
use of function word categories on their conversational partner's usage
and uses these alignment estimates to predict language outcome scores.

At base, for each utterance the model predicts whether the speaker will
produce a word from a given function word category. This prediction is
generated by two factors: the speaker's baseline propensity towards
using that category and the speaker's tendency to align, producing words
from a category just used by their partner. In the model, the primary
computation mimics a standard logistic regression - the production of a
category within an utterance is treated as a binary outcome variable
impacted by a linear combination of predictor variables (here, baseline
usage and alignment.) The model's hierarchical structure then allows the
estimates of baseline usage and alignment effects to be pooled across
individual speakers and categories in a way that ensures statistical
robustness.

The model used here then incorporates these alignment and baseline usage
estimates as predictors in a linear regression model of the Pearson
Peabody Vocabulary Test (PPVT) (Dunn \& Dunn, 1997), a widely used
inventory for tracking language development. Measures of vocabulary like
the PPVT offer a robust snapshot of overall language abilities
throughout early language development, with PPVT scores in particular
correlating with various other measures of cognitive ability (Hodapp,
Gerken, \& 1999, 1999; Naglieri, 1981). As one of various measures of
cognitive and language ability present within the LDP dataset, we
selected the PPVT for its reliability and validity in addition to it
being a measure not based solely on parent report. At this stage, PPVT
is estimated as a linear combination of predictors reflecting alignment
and baseline usage estimates for both parents and children, alongside
other features representing demographic variables (e.g., child's gender,
mother's education) and the child's age. Moreover, the PPVT was
administered to each child in LDP at least twice, allowing us to
estimate interaction effects between parameter and demographic variables
with age.

\hypertarget{model-details}{%
\subsection{Model Details}\label{model-details}}

The structure of the model used here greatly resembles that used in
Yurovsky et al. (2016), in that it operates over utterances represented
as binary vectors, with indices indicating the presence or absence of
each of the 14 LIWC categories used within alignment literatures
(Pennebaker et al., 2015) to designate function words (Table 2). The
probability of producing each category in each utterance is computed via
two parameters: the speaker's baseline usage of that LIWC category
(\(\eta^{base}\)), and the change in that speaker's baseline as a
function of interacting with the listener (\(\eta^{align}\)). So, for a
given category \(c\), for replies to utterances that don't contain
\(c\), the production parameter for that category is computed by
applying the inverse logit function to the appropriate baseline log
odds: \[
P(Production_c) = logit^{-1}(\eta^{base}_c)
\] Alternatively, replies to utterances that \emph{do} contain \(c\),
the parameter computation takes into account the sum of the baseline and
alignment log odds: \[
P(Production_c) = logit^{-1}(\eta^{base}_c+\eta^{align}_c)
\]

To accommodate the variance in production across the LIWC categories,
each baseline usage parameter was drawn from an uninformative prior
(\(\eta^{base} \sim Uniform(-5,5)\)); alignment parameters were
regularized towards 0 by way of implementing a conservative prior
(\(\eta^{align} \sim Normal(0,.25)\)).

All parameters were estimated hierarchically, which allows intelligent
pooling of data across participants in the dataset. To start, each
subpopulation (i.e., parents vs.~children) obtained an estimate. Then,
every speaker had an alignment estimate drawn from their appropriate
subpopulation (e.g., if Speaker 22 is a child, their alignment estimate
is drawn from the estimate for children overall.) Category-level
alignment estimates were then drawn for each speaker (e.g., the
alignment estimate for Speaker 22's usage of determiners is drawn from
Speaker 22's overall alignment estimate.) The order was flipped for
baseline estimates in order to better reflect empirical baseline usages
across LIWC categories; subpopulation estimates produced category-level
estimates, which then produced speaker-level estimates. As in Yurovsky
et al. (2016), we also include parameters that allow baseline and
alignment probabilities to change linearly over time (\(\beta\) and
\(\alpha\) respectively).

Next, we extend the model used in Yurovsky et al. (2016) by using
estimated alignment (i.e., \(\eta\) parameters) to predict PPVT scores,
a measure of vocabulary development (Dunn \& Dunn, 1997). To do so, we
implement a regression model where PPVT scores are modeled as linear
combinations of various predictor variables. These predictor variables
included the child's age, alignment parameter estimates for the child
and their parent, the mother's education, the child's gender, as well as
interaction effects for all variables with age. We use mother's
education as a well known proxy for socioeconomic status (Hollingshead,
1975). Error variance for the model (\(\sigma\)) was also estimated.

The model implemented here then serves two purposes: (1) It extends the
analysis of Yurovsky et al. (2016) to a new dataset, aiming to replicate
previous findings in a more diverse and representative sample, and (2)
It incorporates alignment estimates in a predictive model of early
language outcomes, serving to test the hypothesis that alignment has a
significant relationship with language development, even in the presence
of demographic features. To be specific, we hope to replicate non-zero
estimates for \(\eta\) parameters (demonstrating that alignment between
parents and children exists across datasets), positive \(\beta\) for
children (showing that children increase their baseline usage of
categories over time), and negative \(\alpha\) for parents (showing that
parents decrease their alignment as their children age.) If the PPVT
model estimates for parameters corresponding to the main or interaction
effects of alignment are non-zero in the presence of demographic
variables, we can infer that alignment has a relationship with
vocabulary development independent of features like socioeconomic
status, bolstering the linguistic tuning hypothesis.

\section{Analysis}\label{analysis}}

\hypertarget{data-and-methodology}{%
\subsection{Data and Methodology}\label{data-and-methodology}}

Conversations between parents and their children were drawn from the
Language Development Project Corpus (Goldin-Meadow et al., 2014).
Participants in the project were videorecorded in their homes for
\(\sim\) 90 minutes every four months starting when the child was
14-months and ending at 58-months. Additionally, all participants took
the PPVT on at least two occasions during the observation period.
Participants were selected in order to produce a diverse sample
demographically representative of the broader Chicagoland area. LDP is
smaller than other comparable corpora of child-parent conversations
(e.g., CHILDES), but it stands alone in its broad representation of
families across the socioeconomic spectrum.

We selected for analysis all children who were typically developing and
completed at least 10 of the 12 planned recording sessions. Our sample
consisted of 59 target children, 28 of whom were girls, 12 were Black
and 6 were Multiracial. Children were also socio-economically diverse,
as measured by mother's education: 2 mothers had some highschool
education, 7 had a highschool degree, 10 had some college or trade
school, 19 had college degrees, and 21 had advanced degrees.

Following Yurovsky et al. (2016), successive utterances from a speaker
within a transcript were concatenated into a single utterance.
Individual utterances were then transformed into binary vectors with
indices indicating the presence or absence of each of the 14 LIWC
categories. This pre-processing turned every transcript into a
speaker-reply format: each utterance within a transcript was both a
reply to the preceding utterance and a message to the next one.

Each transcript was then compressed, yielding 4 numbers for each LIWC
category. For a pair of speakers \emph{A} and \emph{B} in a transcript,
for each LIWC category, we computed the number of utterances from
\emph{A} to \emph{B} containing the category (\(N^{align}\)), the number
of utterances from \emph{A} to \emph{B} not containing the category
(\(N^{base}\)), the number of utterances containing the category
responding to an utterance containing the category (\(C^{align}\)), and
the number of utterances containing the category responding to an
utterance not containing the category (\(C^{base}\)). Aggregating in
this way provided the platform for the model's sampling - for each
transcript, \(C^{base}\) and \(C^{align}\) were drawn from Binomial
distributions parameterized by \(N^{base}\) and \(N^{align}\) chances
respectively, with probabilities computed via the logistic regression
models outlined above.\\
Sampling was performed using Stan, a probabilistic programming language
that implements Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling methods (Carpenter et
al., 2017). Posterior distributions for each parameter in the model were
estimated using 500 iterations of Bayesian sampling, generating mean
assessments with appropriate confidence intervals.

\subsection{Results}\label{results}}

Alignment estimates (\(\eta^{align}\)) for parents and children were
both estimated above zero, corroborating the findings of Yurovsky et al.
(2016) in showing that both groups exhibit alignment (Figure 1). We also
replicate the finding that parents appear to align more to their
children than children align to their parents.

The model estimates changes in baseline category production across
development (\(\beta\)) at approximately zero for parents, but
significantly above zero for children, replicating previous findings.
Alignment is estimated as having a significantly negative age effect
(\(\alpha\)) for parents in this dataset, replicating an earlier finding
that alignment from parents to children tends to decrease over their
child's development (Figure 3).

The mean estimates for PPVT predictors are presented in Table 2; they
illustrate effects on a child's average PPVT score as well as estimates
of interaction effects with age (i.e., the rate at which PPVT improves
over development.) As expected, PPVT is positively associated with the
age of the child and their being female. Moreover, female children tend
to have a decreased age effect on PPVT; female children have a higher
average PPVT score relative to male counterparts, but their scores
improve over time more gradually. Mother's education is negatively
associated with PPVT, but has a slight positive age effect. Alongside
these demographic effects, we see robust alignment effects on PPVT:
child and parental alignment are both associated with increased PPVT,
but with decreased age effects.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

In an effort to understand and investigate how children rapidly acquire
language, some argue that the language parents produce to their children
is somehow calibrated to the child's particular needs and abilities
(Snow, 1972). While the idea is theoretically compelling, empirical work
has produced mixed results, with strong results in favor of (Chouinard
\& Clark, 2003; Hirsh-Pasek et al., 1984) and against (Brown \& Hanlon,
1970; Hayes \& Ahrens, 1988).

However, much of this prior work investigates tuning as an overt effort
on behalf of parents or tuning with respect to content words, with less
examining the potential role of low-level syntactic influence (Hoff,
2003). Yurovsky et al. (2016) presents just such an examination,
demonstrating using Bayesian hierarchical modeling that parents align to
their children according to their particular language usage at the level
of function word categories. This paper extends their model by applying
it to a new socioeconomically diverse sample of families (Goldin-Meadow
et al., 2014) and leveraging the model's alignment estimates to predict
language development outcomes.

The analysis presented here replicates the findings of Yurovsky et al.
(2016), showing strong alignment effects for both parents and their
children, a substantial age effect for baseline useage in children, and
a significant negative effect of age on alignment for parents. Moreover,
we demonstrate that these alignment estimates have substantial power in
predicting vocabulary development measures, even in the presence of
demographic features such as gender and socioeconomic status. We
corroborate previous findings that female children tend to have higher
PPVT scores that improve more gradually over time (Kaushanskaya, Gross,
\& Buac, 2013; Lange, Euler, \& Zaretsky, 2016). We conflict with other
findings that positively associate child PPVT scores with mother's
education (Di Cesare, Sabates, \& Lewin, 2013; Schady, 2011); this may
be due to idiosyncracies of our dataset, including its limited size.

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{figure*}[tb]

Points indicate the mean of the posterior distribution; shaded regions indicate 68\% highest probability density intervals, equivalent to one standard deviation, for visualization purposes.}\label{fig:hpds}
\end{figure*}
\end{CodeChunk}

We show that parental alignment is associated with a relatively large
boost in average PPVT scores, but with a negative age effect. The
negative age effect may source from a ceiling on PPVT - children with
higher average scores may simply have less ground to cover.
Nevertheless, these results are consistent with a concrete effect of
parental alignment on vocabulary development, and the linguistic tuning
hypothesis more broadly. A similar story is evident from child alignment
estimates: alignment has a small association with overall PPVT score and
an age effect comparable to parental alignment. Here there may be a
confound with childrens' baseline language production, in that children
with lower production will have lower PPVT and diminished alignment as a
result; future work should assess this interaction to better isolate the
effects of alignment.

Overall, these results show that parental alignment within function word
categories is a robust effect that appears to have a relationship with
childrens' language development independent of demographic correlates,
serving to further the linguistic tuning hypothesis.
